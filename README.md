# NLP-and-Text-Mining
The NLP_TextMining notebook includes tokenizing, stemming, lemmatization, stopwords removal, Parts-Of-Speech (POS) tagging, text chunking, named entity recognition and abbreviation detection.

The Inverted Index notebook consists of a mapping of words to their locations in a set of documents. This inverted index omits "and","but", ...  and supports AND and OR queries. We only need to put our txt files (our books, docs,... ) in a folder named Document and put it in the same directory as the python code is running. Query.txt file should also be placed in the same folder.
